# A Novel Semi-supervised Learning Model Based On Pelvic Radiographs For Ankylosing Spondylitis Diagnosis Reduces 90\% Of Annotation Cost

This is a README file for the Paper: "A Novel Semi-supervised Learning Model Based On Pelvic Radiographs For Ankylosing Spondylitis Diagnosis Reduces 90\% Of Annotation Cost."

## Description

The Project is a web application and a local application built with Python 3.7. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing specific tasks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- Dependencies listed in requirements.txt

## Installation

1. Create a virtual environment using Python 3.7.
2. Activate the virtual environment.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Usage

### Gradio Web Application

1. Double-click the 'start_gradio.bat' file to run the Gradio version of the web application.
2. Once the application is running, copy the local network URL provided in the console.
3. Paste the URL into a web browser to access and use the application.
